Problem Statement

Welcome to Day 4! Check out a video review of logical operations here
	(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zj5eD0a6sm4&feature=youtu.be), or just jump right
	into the problem.

Note: This task is focused on Object Oriented concepts, so it is only enabled in a few languages.

You will create a class Person and write a constructor that takes an integer, initial_Age. In this
	constructor, you should check that the initial_Age is not negative because we can't have people
	with negative ages.

If the initial_Age is negative, set the instance's age equal to zero then print

	"This person is not valid, setting age to 0."

without the quotations..

Inside of this class, you will also create an instance variable called age and if initial_Age
	is not negative,
	then you will set age to equal the value of initial_Age. In addition, you will write an instance
	method, amIOld(), that prints whether people are old or not to the console.

In amIOld(), do the following things:

If the age of the Person instance is less than 13, then print "You are young."
If the age of the Person instance is equal or greater than 13, but less 18, print "You are a teenager."
Otherwise, print "You are old."
In addition, create an instance function called yearPasses() that increases the age of the person instance by one.

Much of the structure of the code is given to you below, but in the future, you will write this. The code
	that will create instances of your Person class is in the main function. You may not understand it all
	yet, but take a look just to see what's going on. Do not change any of the variable names or remove any
	of the code given.

Input Format

First line contains T, number of test cases. Each test case contains an integer age, representing age of the person.

Constraints 
1<=T<=4 
-5<=age<=30
Output Format

The code that will test your methods is already in the editor. All you have to do is edit the methods given
	to you in the editor so that they perform correctly as stated above. If your methods are implemented
	correctly, each testcase will print out either two or three lines.

If the age is less than zero, then your program should print out:

	This person is not valid, setting age to 0.
	You are young.
	You are young.
	
If the age is equal or greater than 0, then your program should print out two lines. The first line that
	the program prints out should be the output of amIOld() on the current age. Then, three years pass
	via yearPasses() and the second line the program prints should be the output of amIOld() after the
	time has passed.

Sample Input

	4
	-1
	10
	16
	18
	
Sample Output

	This person is not valid, setting age to 0.
	You are young.
	You are young.

	You are young.
	You are a teenager.

	You are a teenager.
	You are old.

	You are old.
	You are old.

Explanation

For the first testcase, the age is less than 0 so we set the age to 0.Three years pass and the age is 3. So we print out:

	This person is not valid, setting age to 0.
	You are young.
	You are young.

For the second testcase, the age is 10, which is considered young according to our program. Three years
	pass and the age is 13. 13 is considered a 'teenager' age so we print out:

	You are young.
	You are a teenager.
	
For the third testcase, the age is 16, which is the age of a teenager. Three years pass and the age is
	19. 19 is considered an 'old' age according to our program so we print out:

	You are a teenager.
	You are old.

For the last testcase, the age is 18, which is considered an old age according to our program. Three
	years pass and the age is 21. 21 is still considered old so we print out:

	You are old.
	You are old.
