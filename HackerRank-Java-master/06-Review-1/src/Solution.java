Problem Statement

Welcome to Day 6! Review everything we've learned so far by making a MadLibs program in
	this video(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsMfF0d5L20&feature=youtu.be), or just
	jump right into the problem.

Your teacher has given you the task of drawing a staircase structure. Being an expert
	programmer, you decided to make a program to draw it for you instead. Given the
	required height, can you print a staircase as shown in the example?
	
Note: The last line has zero spaces before it.

Good luck!

Constraints
 
1<=N<=100

Input Format

You are given an integer N depicting the height of the staircase.

Output Format

Print a staircase of height N that consists of # symbols and spaces as given in Sample Output.

Sample Input
