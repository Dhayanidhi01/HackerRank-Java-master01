Welcome to Day 18! Review this queues and stacks video and the
	Java documentation for implementing stacks and queues
	(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOHLom4hZME&feature=youtu.be), or
	just jump right into the problem.

A palindrome is a "word, phrase, number, or other sequence of
	characters which reads the same backwards and forwards."
	Can you determine if a given string, s, is a palindrome?

To solve this challenge, we must first take each character in
	s, enqueue it in a queue, and also push it onto a stack.
	Once that's done, we must dequeue the first character from
	the queue and pop the top character off the stack, then
	compare the two characters to see if they are the same;
	as long as the characters match, we continue dequeueing,
	popping, and comparing each character until our containers
	are empty (a non-match means s isn't a palindrome).

Write the following four functions/methods in class Palindrome:

void pushCharacter(char ch): Pushes a character onto a stack.
void enqueueCharacter(char ch): Enqueues a character in a queue.
char popCharacter(): Pops and returns the top character.
char dequeueCharacter(): Dequeues and returns the first character.
Code handling Input/Output and determining if s is palindrome is
	provided in the editor.

Input Format

A single line containing string s.

Note: s will always be lowercase.

Output Format

If s is a palindrome, print "The word, s, is a palindrome." 
Otherwise, print "The word, s, is not a palindrome." without quotes

Sample Input

racecar

Sample Output

The word, racecar, is a palindrome.
