Problem Statement

Welcome to Day 3! Check out a review of if-else statements here
	(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Yum5sXxT8&feature=youtu.be), or just jump right
	into the problem.

Using "if-else" you can perform decision making in your code. See the flowchart
	below (taken from wikipedia):

This problem will test your knowledge on "if-else" statements.

Given an integer N as input, check the following:

If N is odd, print "Weird".
If N is even and, in between the range of 2 and 5(inclusive), print "Not Weird".
If N is even and, in between the range of 6 and 20(inclusive), print "Weird".
If N is even and N>20, print "Not Weird".
We have given you partially completed code in the editor, complete it to solve the problem.

Input Format

There is a single line of input: integer N.

Constraints 
1≤N≤100
Output Format

Print "Weird" if the number is weird. Otherwise, print "Not Weird". Do not print the quotation marks.

Sample Input 1

3

Sample Output 1

Weird

Explanation 
N=3, is odd hence the its a Weird Number.

Sample Input 2

24

Sample Output 2

Not Weird

Explanation
N=24, is >20 hence its not a Weird Number.
